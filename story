Once upon a time in Cybertron, HotShot & his friends were playing cube in the cube game.
They played for sometime, then they all went home. After that, Optimus Prime came to see a recruit. He was trying to 
find some recruits to come to Earth.

Then he saw HotShot playing cube still in the cube court. Then he offered HotShot a better job to build up the ranks
of the Rescue Bots Academy which chooses the best of the best.
